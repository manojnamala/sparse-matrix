# Sparse Matrix Implementation in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment Description
This project implements an **array-based representation of sparse matrices** in C++.  
A sparse matrix is a matrix where most elements are zero, and only non-zero elements are stored efficiently in **triplet form** (row, column, value).

The program allows:
- Reading non-zero elements from the user
- Displaying the sparse matrix in triplet form
- Displaying the sparse matrix in full form
